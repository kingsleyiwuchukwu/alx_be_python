## Basic Arithmetic Exercise

- Objective:

To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

- Task Description:

You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. The script should do the following:

- Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
- Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.

## Simple Interest Calculator

- Objective:

Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

- Task Description:

Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:

( I ) is the interest earned,
( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

## Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

- Objective:
  
  Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

- Task Description:

For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

## Convert Hours to Seconds

- Objective:
  
  Demonstrate understanding of variable assignments and arithmetic operations by converting a given number of hours into seconds.

- Task Description:

For this task, write a Python script that converts a specific number of hours into seconds. This task reinforces the concept of arithmetic operations within a practical context.

## User Input Age Calculator

- Objective:
  
  Practice receiving user input in Python and perform a simple arithmetic operation to calculate the user’s age in a future year.

- Task Description:

Create a Python script that asks the user for their current age and then calculates how old they will be in a specific future year. This task introduces handling user input and reinforces arithmetic operations.

## Personal Finance Calculator

- Objective:
  
  Use user input, variables, and arithmetic operations to calculate and provide feedback on a user’s monthly savings and potential future savings without applying conditional statements.

- Task Description:

You will create a script named finance_calculator.py. This script will calculate the user’s monthly savings based on inputted monthly income and expenses. It will then project these savings over a year, assuming a fixed interest rate, to demonstrate compound interest’s effect on savings.
