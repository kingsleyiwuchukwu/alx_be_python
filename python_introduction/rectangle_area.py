# Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

# Declared two variable
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length Ã— width)
Area = length * width

# Display the result
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {Area}")
